   <h3>Describe how search engines work</h3>
   <p>Search engines have two major functions: crawling and
    building an index, and providing search users with a ranked list
    of the websites they've determined are the most relevant. The best way for google 
	to crawl is through links.These links will allow the search engines automated 
	robots called crawlers or spiders to reach all the interconnect pages or documents 
	on the web. Once the engines find these pages, they convert the code from them and store selected
    pieces in massive databases, to be recalled later when needed for a search query. </p>
	
	<p>To accomplish the monumental task of holding billions of pages that can be accessed in a
    fraction of a second, the search engine companies have constructed datacenters all over the
    world.These monstrous storage facilities hold thousands of machines processing large quantities of
    information very quickly. When a person performs a search at any of the major engines, they
    demand results instantaneously; even a one- or two-second delay can cause dissatisfaction,
    so the engines work hard to provide answers as fast as possible.</p>
	
	<h3>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h3>
    <p>keywords and description as meta tags is very important for search engine optimization (SEO) listings. 
    the keyword meta tag is very important because the key word you use is what the SEO will present to the users.
    The key words will determine your sites position on the search engine results page (SERP). 
    Good keyword usage will take your page to the top of the SERPs page. That is, 
    when a user do a search, a good keyword usage on your page will put your page at the top of the listing.</p>
   
	<p>The description meta tag is vital as it is where you put your sites summary. What you offer. 
	This is very important as google might use it as a snippet for your page if it does not find a good
	selection of text in your page content to use as snippet.</p>
	
	<h3>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links</h3>
    <p>The four elements that comprise writing relevant content links are;</p>
    <ul class="four">
	 <li>Links should us relevant or natural achor text</li>
	 <li>Links should bring quality traffic to your site</li>
	 <li>Links should be a healthy mix of follow and nofollow</li>
	 <li>Links should be strategically targeted</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag</h3>
    <p>A good heading hierarchy make it easy for users and machines to understand the content. 
    That is, it provides visual consistency. To implement a good heading hierarchy, it is importannt to note that
    there are 6 types of heading. 
	</p>
	<ul class="four">
	<li>h1 should always be used at the top of the sequence and h6 at the bottom of the sequence.</li>
	<li>Only one h1 element should be used on each page and at the top of the page content</li>
	<li>Most headings on a page should be h2 or h3</li>
	<li>h4 to h6 should be used only when neccessary especially on adding less important information on a page like a sidebar</li>
	<li>And the headings should be short, unique, descriptive and on topic</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Below is an example of a heading hierarchy from top to bottom is how important the heading is. It is from h2 heading to h6.</p>
	
	<h2>This is a heading</h2>
	<h3>This is a heading</h3>
	<h4>This is a heading</h4>
	<h5>This is a heading</h5>
	<h6>This is a heading</h6>
